# ðŸ“• Deep PDF 

A Python-based tool specifically designed to solve the challenge of extracting data from complex PDF tables, including nested tables and intricate layouts. While most PDF extraction tools struggle with complex table structures, this project uses advanced techniques to accurately parse and extract data from sophisticated table formats.

## Features

- Advanced table extraction handling:
  - Nested tables with multiple levels of hierarchy
  - Complex merged cells and spanning columns/rows
  - Tables with mixed formatting and styles
  - Multiple tables on the same page
  - Tables split across pages
- Intelligent structure recognition for nested data
- Web-based interface using Streamlit for easy interaction
- Modular architecture for different types of extractors
- OpenAI integration for enhanced parsing accuracy

## Key Differentiators

This tool specifically addresses common challenges in PDF table extraction:

- **Nested Structure Recognition**: Accurately identifies and preserves hierarchical relationships in nested tables
- **Complex Layout Handling**: Successfully processes tables with irregular layouts, merged cells, and varying formats
- **Structural Integrity**: Maintains the logical structure of complex tables in the extracted data
- **Format Preservation**: Retains the semantic meaning of nested data relationships

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies:
  - streamlit >= 1.24.0
  - openai >= 1.0.0
  - pdfplumber >= 0.9.0
  - Pillow >= 9.5.0
  - python-dotenv >= 1.0.0

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd pdf-extractor
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
mkdir -p .streamlit && echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"' > .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

## Usage

### Running the Web Interface

Start the Streamlit application:
```bash
cd streamlit_app
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using as a Library

```python
from pdf_extractor.extractors.table_extractor import TableExtractor

# Initialize the extractor
extractor = TableExtractor()

# Extract complex tables from a PDF
tables = extractor.extract("path/to/your.pdf")

# The extracted data maintains nested structure
# Example output format for nested tables:
# {
#     'main_table': {
#         'header': ['Col1', 'Col2'],
#         'nested_tables': {
#             'position': [1, 1],  # Location in main table
#             'data': {...}        # Nested table content
#         }
#     }
# }
```

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture optimized for complex table extraction:

- `core/base_extractor.py`: Defines the base extractor class with common functionality
- `extractors/table_extractor.py`: Implements advanced table extraction logic
  - Handles nested structure detection
  - Manages complex cell relationships
  - Processes multi-level hierarchies
- `config/constants.py`: Contains configuration constants
- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities for table processing

## Development

The project uses a modular structure that allows for easy extension:

1. Base classes in `core/` define common interfaces
2. Specialized extractors in `extractors/` implement complex table parsing
3. Configuration is centralized in `config/`
4. Web interface provides visual feedback and extraction results
